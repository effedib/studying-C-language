# **Travel Expense Manager**

This project consists of developing a travel expense manager that allows users to calculate and track expenses during a trip. The user will be able to enter the daily expenses for different categories (accommodation, transport, meals, etc.) and at the end of the trip he will obtain a summary of the total expenses.

## **Objective**
The goal of the project is to provide users with a practical tool to manage and track travel expenses efficiently. Using variables, strings, mathematical calculations, conditional operators and loops, the manager will allow users to record daily expenses for different categories and calculate the total expenses at the end of the trip.

## **Main features**

Acquisition of travel information:

- Ask the user for the number of travel days and store it in a numeric variable.
- Ask the user for the total budget available for the trip and store it in a numeric variable.

## **Registration of daily expenses**

- Using a for loop, ask the user to enter daily expenses for different categories such as lodging, transportation, meals, etc.
- Store daily expenses in separate numeric variables for each category.
- Use the assignment operator (+=) to accumulate daily expenses into total variables for each category.

## **Calculation of total expenses**

- Use a for loop to iterate through the total expense variables for each category and calculate the total expense.
- Store total expenses in a numeric variable.

## **Results display**

- Print to screen a summary of total expenses for each category and the grand total of expenses.
- Also show if the available budget has been respected or expenses have been exceeded.

## **Exception Handling**

- Use a while loop to allow the user to correct any expense entry errors.
- Ask the user if they want to make changes to the charges and allow editing of previous charges.
- Automatically update expense totals based on user changes.
